  My name is Tô Tự Cường. I'm currently working on scaling up truth-discovery algorithms using stochastic variational inference.
  Truth discovery techniques are used to compute correct values from a set of conflicting ones provided by different data sources.
  These techniques have a wide range of applications in different fields such as crowd/social sensing, computational journalism (detecting fake news), data integration, or knowledge graph construction.
  The challenge is to scale truth discovery techniques to cope with millions of data points coming from millions of sources.
