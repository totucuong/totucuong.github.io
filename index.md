title: Bayesian data analysis and more.

---

I notice that it is often hard to see the relationship between machine learning algorithms. In this blog, I will write tutorial about diffrent topics and explain how they are related to each other. Most of the theory are drawn from the book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop and the demo will be written in Python notebook.

What does this mean by doing data analysis? I try to follow the Box loop.
