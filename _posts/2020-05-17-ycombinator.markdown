I'm reading a lot of startup materials these days. I find the startupschool materials from Y Combinator is short yet very useful. They have a series of video lectures. Each lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. More importantly, their advices are very actionable. You can apply them immediately. A good example is the lecture on [customer development](https://youtu.be/MT4Ig2uqjTc)
Once you are done with customer development, at least temporarily, you can move on to pitching your idea. I find that [this video](https://youtu.be/5ip-Zf4mGeU) captures very well what pitching means.
